      It is a summer of 1985 or 1986, I am not certain anymore, at this stage of my life. I am a very young boy, having a time of my life with my family, by one of the many beautifull lagoons in the north of Poland. 
      I am still recovering though, from the tragedy which for me at that time was the end of my favoiurire band called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Talking" title="Link to Modern Talking on Wikipedia" target="_blank">Modern Talking</a>
      I vividly rember the overwhelming sadness I was submerged in. Life felt extremly unfair as the 8/9 years old me could not understand the reasons of why my favourite band had broken up.<br>
      I remeber playing, by the summer the cabin my parents were renting, and listening to one of the radios stations available at that time in Poland. If am not being tricked by my memory, there must have been
      an audition called "Lato z Radiem" on, which was playing music from the Western Europe, music whichj was craved by the common mortal, from behind of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain" title="Link to Iron Curtain on Wikipedia"target="_blank">Iron Curtain</a>.
      The sound of an unfamiliar song came out from the radio speaker. I got intrigued by it but missed the name of the artist. I had to wait till the next day to hear this song again.<br>
      By this time I was prepared, waiting by the radio the etire morning, trying to catch the song again. The radio DJ annouced next song and there she was, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_(singer)" title="Link to Sandra on Wikipedia"target="_blank">Sandra</a>
      and her song <a href="https://youtu.be/4sduSCZ9ac4?s" title="Link to Inoccent Love on YouTube" target="_blank">Inoccent Love</a>!! The new star of my universe was born. I no longer mourned the break up of Modern Talking. My heart was stolen by her, the beautiful girl from West Germany.
      As a typical annoying child of that era I started nagging my parents to get me any available magazine or newspaper which could potentialy have any publication about her. I wanted to know who she was. What did she look like? Where was she from 
      (<i>because she sang in English I was adamant she was either British or American</i>)? I was so umberable that my poor dad went to the nearby village to get me one of the available magazines, which could not have anything about her in printing.
      Much to my displeasure there was nothing about her in the magazine I got. The world was against me and I could bear it anymore!! I wanted for the holidays to end asap, pack my stuff and go back home.
      For obvious reasons no one understood the struggle I was going through and everyone carried on as nothing had happened.<br>
      A few more days had passed before we finally went back home. It took another week or two before I saw her for the first time on the tv. 
      She was there in her full grace. The most beautiful women in the world. Mesmerising godess for which I lost my mind entirely. My room or rather the available wall became a "Temple of Sandra".<br>
      Little by little the collection od her posters was growing slowly from surely. As a result of it the collage made of the various Sandra's posters was expanding. If I am not tricked by my memory, at some point the collection consisted of over 200 pictures, posters and clippers. Total madness!<br>
      The rest is history. First cassette (<i>some dodgy illegal copy of one of her albums</i>), first CD (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7wKFlqXZrKdO0dSVw5jB3b?si=WizemHCIRYK_8l-opaAOEg" title="Link to Close to Seven on Spotify" target="_blank">Close to Seven</a>). Countless of hits. 
      <a href="https://youtu.be/5LCMASUqtZw?si=F1F3oxblMPNUp6DB" title="Link to Secret Land video on YouTube" target="_blank">"Secret Land"</a>,
      <a href="https://youtu.be/bqICGrdLGIc?si=KMqn15bvCJYbAaUH" title="Link to Everlasting Love video on YouTube" target="_blank">"Everlasting Love"</a>,
      <a href="https://youtu.be/hyVlyhcO6KE?si=5cUmBHFtkxiP6o1N" title="Link to Don't be agressive video on YouTube" target="_blank">"Don't be agressive"</a>, to name a few (<i>link to one of her compilations here
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0Zv6sd3xXpR08QiZIRsp60?si=QIv1x_2mT2qAng91ioLIOA" title="Link to The Best of Sandra on Spotify" target="_blank">The Very Best of Sandra</a></i>).
      Pararel to her solo career, she took a part in extremly successfull project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_(German_band)" title="Link to Enigma on Wikipedia">Enigma</a>, which sold over 70 millions albums worldwide.<br>
      I will not be getting into the details of all Sandra achivments because all of them can be found on Wikipedia or her <a href="https://sandra-music.com/en/">official website</a>.<br>
      The purpose of this website is to gather like-minded people and with their help to achive an unachievable goal of getting Netflix, HBO, Amazon etc to film a documentry about Sandra.
      Such project would be a unique opportunity to show her extraordinary career. She was Beyonce, before Beyonce was even born. Leading a girl band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabesque_(group)" title="Link to Enigma on Wikipedia">Arabesque</a>. Embarking for a successfull solo project. Taking part in recording for Enigma.
      The story is there. The rise to a megastardome in 80's and 90's. Becoming mother. The decrese in popularity. Several comebacks. Divorce. Surviving breast cancer. The story writes itself.
      What is needed is a group of proffecionals, whou would be able to create a documentry Sandra and her fans deserve. Addressing her career, private life, alleged hostility from BBC. There is still so much still to discover.<br>
      All of it can happen if Sandra's fans use this website as a tool to draw attetion of right companies and people to start the project. All I am asking for is to share it via social media ( links to do that below). Send and email to the mentioned companies via email template (see below).
      Hopefully the effort of every single one of us will make this dream of mine come true. And if that happens, I will become the happiest person on this planet.
      Let's get going then!
